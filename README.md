# Duckling

English | [中文](./README.zh.md)

Duckling is a lightweight desktop application built using Tauri, designed for quickly browsing `parquet`/`csv` file data and various databases.
It supports [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb)/SQLite.

Note: The current objective of this project is not to develop a fully functional database management tool, but rather to facilitate quick browsing of various types of data.

## Installation

From [releases](https://github.com/l1xnan/Duckling/releases) page to download the latest installation package, for
